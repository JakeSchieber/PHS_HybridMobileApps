Lesson 7 Objectives.

This lesson will be taught differently than past lessons, I will spend the beginning of the class reviewing with the students our previous lessons. I will then go over the content for the day (this should take 10-15 minutes). I will then send the students to their desks and allow for them to finish a project which I will designate to them in a handour.
