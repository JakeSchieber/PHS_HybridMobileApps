Lesson 7 Objectives.

This lesson will be taught differently than past lessons, I want to teach in a more hands on and recollective environment (as opposed to a follow along with me style). So I will spend the beginning of the class reviewing with the students our previous lessons (this should take 10-15 minutes). I will then send the students to their desks and allow for them to finish the project which I will designated to them in a digital handout. This handout will be a boiler plate which will contain helpful notes and guidance. As a group the students will then worked together, complete the handout, asking questions as they go.
