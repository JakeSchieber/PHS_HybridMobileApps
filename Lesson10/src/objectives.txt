The objectives for Lesson 10 are the exact same objectives as for Lesson 9.
Lesson 9 was taught during a shortened school day due to an early release and it turned into
mostly review the week before. In that time we went over for loops. The use of push and pull.
The creation of Arrays. And the use of the .length property when using a for loop.

Objectives:
Have the students open up the javascript console without guidance.
Have the students create an array without guidance
Have the students create a loop with some suggestion (review of the .length property) 
Have the students decide on their own that an if statement can be used for control flow.
Teach the students how we can pull from an array???

Lesson 9 has been extremely extended to make the lesson10 which we see here.
