    <h1>Lesson 10</h1>
    <h4>Part 1:</h4>
    <p>Lets take a look at our console! So open up this code in one window, and open up chrome in the other with the javascript console showing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open up chrome > View > Developer Tools > Javascript Console</li>
      <li><b>OR</b> right click the page > Inspect > Console</li>
      <li>If you have done this correctly, when you load this page you should see the a message appear in the console.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Follow along with the instructions in the code to continue this lesson.</p>

    <script>
      console.log("Lesson 9 Fun Fun: Begin here.");

       * REVIEW: Functions!
       * 
       * Functions allow for us to create code which we can reuse! This saves us time and allows for us to write
       * fewer lines of code that does more.
       * ex:  
        
        // a function which alerts Baby
        function alertMeBaby() {
          alert("baby");
        } 
        
        // We can place this code any where inside of our script tags and call it like this:
        alertMeBaby();
        
       * 
       * We can also add something called parameters to our function which allows for us to send in information
       * that will allow for the function to run differently on each run.
       * 
       * ex: 
        
        function alertSpecialSome(specialSomeOnesName) {
          // alerts to the screen the name of our special someone.
          alert(specialSomeOnesName);
        }
        
        // we can then call this code like this.
        alertSpecialSome("Daisy");

       * Lets call this function 'printArray'
       * 
       * When you have completed our loop, send it the variable 'test' below to see if our function works.

       * Now lets start where we left off last week:
       * 
       * One of the best features of javascript is the ability to add and remove from an array.
       * So this means once we create an array with: 
       * 
       *    var a = [];
       * 
       * That we can add elements to the array with:
       * 
       *    a.push("a word"); // add a string to an array
       *    OR 
       *    a.push(1); // add a number to an array

       */

      /**
       * Sometimes in Javacsript we also need to remove items from an array.
       * Luckily for us javascript has a function that allows for us to do this.
       * 
       *  a.splice(i, c); // this removes from array a, c elements starting at index i.
       *  ex: a.splice(0, 2); // starts removing items from index one, then removes the next 2 items from that index

       * NOTE: The code below is what we did last week to accomplish this task, lets make sure to use our push
       * function this time around!

       * 
       * HINT: we can use the expression a.charAt(i); on strings to get the ith letter of that string.
       * ex:
       *  var a = "Jake";
       *  a.charAt(2); // Returns 'k' because a is at index 2 in the array (remember arrays are 0-indexed, meaning 
       *                // that the first item is item 0)

      /**
       * A common check in computer science is whether a number is divisible by 2.
       * Javascript makes this extremely easy. Lets create an array that adds all of the even numbers 1 through
       * 20 to an array.
       * 
       * CHALLENGE 1: Create a loop from 0 to 20, and place an if statement inside the loop that only adds the number 
       * to the array if the number is an even. This check for an even number can easily be performed with a simple arithmatic
       * expression and the Math.round() function which rounds a number to the nearest whole number.
       * 
       * ex: Math.round(2.5); // Outputs the number 3
       *  var a = 2.2;
       *  Math.round(a); // Outputs 2
       * 
       * CHALLENGE 2: What is a much more sneaky way that we could create this array that does not require an if statement?
       * Hacks like these are what programmers are paid to look for. What is the simplest way to accomplish the same thing.
