We ended lesson 2 by connecting the submit button of a form to 
a javascript callback function, but were never able to do any real compution.
For this reason lesson3 will simply be the second half of the calculator of lesson2.

We will need to go over the basic javascript types:

Basic:
String, Number, Boolean

Complex:
Object, Array

Special:
Null, Undefined, NAN

We will further go over form validation as our calculator will require us to trim white space
and convert from type String to Number in order to perform a number based calculation.
We will present this quandry by "Accidental" string concatenation.
