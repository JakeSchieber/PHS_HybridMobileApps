    <h1>Lesson 8</h1>
    <h4>Part 1:</h4>
    <p>Lets take a look at the command line</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open up chrome > View > Developer Tools > Javascript Console</li>
      <li><b>OR</b> right click the page > Inspect > Console</li>
      <li>If you have done this correctly, when you load this page you should see the a message appear in the console.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finish the lesson by following along with the instructions down in the script tags.</p>

    <script>
      // Part 1: Observe the console window.
      console.log("I am looking at the console!");
      
      // Part 2: Write the code below so that your first name is written to the console window.
      
      // Part 3: Save your last name to a variable then try to print that variable out on the screen.
      
      // Part 4: Lets review types
      // HINT: use console.log() as we go to help answer the questions.
      
      // WHAT type is this?
      var a = 1;
      
      // WHAT type is this?
      var b = "Jake";
      
      // WHAT is c equal to?
      var c = a + b;
      
      // What is e equal to?
      var d = 13;
      var e = a * d;

      // Part 3: 
      var x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
      // print out the 3rd element is printed out to the screen.
      
      // Part 4:
      // Try to access the 10th element in this array... What do you end up seeing in the console window?
      // This is called an ERROR. Using the console window can help us find our bugs and fix our code.
      // Because our array doesnt have a 10th element this breaks our code. Now comment out this code and continue.
      
      // Part 5:
      var x = [6,1,4,5,2,3];
      // create 6 console.log() lines that output the elements in this array so that they are displayed in ascending order
      // ex:
        // console.log(x[1])
        // console.log(x[3])
        // console.log(....)
        
      /*
        Part 6:
        Arrays are used to store multiple values inside of a single container.
        They can be created several ways, but we will create them like this:
        
        var x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];         // This would create an array of numbers.
        
        var y = ["hello", "Im", "Jake"];    // This would create an array of strings.
        
        Arrays are "zero-indexed" meaning that to access the first element in the array we want
        to grab the element at the "zeroeth" location. It's easiest to think about it like saying
        that the first element has 0 space between it and the front of the array.
        
        So to access the zeroeth element in code we can use:  y[0]
        
        Brackets let us access an array at a certain "offset".
        
        Down below output the 3rd element to the array to the console.
        HINT: You should be outputting a 3.
      */
      var x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
      
      /*
        Part 7:
        Down below we have an array that is jumbled. Without changing the array, output the 
        elements one by one to the console so that they appear in in the correct order.
        
        HINT: Your code should look something like this
        
        console.log(jumbled[3]);
        console.log(jumbled[1]);
        ...
      */
      var jumbled = [1, 6, 3, 8, 2, 9];

      /*
        Part 8:
        For loops are one of the best ways for us to loop through array elements.
        Their structure looks like this
        
        for(var i = 0; i < SOME_NUMBER; i++) {
          // SOME CODE
        }
        
        This code says to set i equal to 0, perform some code, and at the end of that code increment i by 1.
        If at that time i is still less than SOME_NUMBER the code in the loop will execute again.
        So, for instance, if we set SOME_NUMBER equal to 3, this code would be executed 3 times,
        once for when i was equal to 0 1 and 2, but the code would then stop when i was equal to 3 because at
        that point i is no longer less than 3.
        
        Create a loop below that loops 5 times, and inside of the loop print the variable i used in the for loop
        to the console.
      */
      
      
      /*
        Part 9:
        Loops in javascript are made to work extremely well with javascript, for this reason arrays have a special
        property called length. We can access this property by adding ".length" to the end of a variable that is holding an
        array. Print out the length of the jumbled array that we used earlier below.
      */
      
      /*
        Part 10:
        This .length property returns a number which we can directly use in our for loops.
        Meaning that if we continuing looping until i is less than array.length we will loop
        once for each element in the array.
        
        Below create a for loop that prints your name to the screen the same number of times that there
        are elements in the jumbled array.
      */
      
      /*
        Part 11:
        The coolest part about these for loops is that if we are executing a loop the same number
        of times that there are elements in an array, we can use our i variable as an offset into our array
        and perform an action for each element in our array.
        
        Below write code that uses the .length property of the jumbled array to print out each element
        in our jumbled array.
        HINT: Remember we will access elements in our jumbled array like this: jumbled[...]
      */
      
      /*
        Part 12:
        Create a for loop that loops through the jumbled array and prints out the number inside of the array
        if it is bigger than 3
        
        HINT: You will need to use an if statement
      */
      
      /*
        Part 13:
        Create a for loop that loops through the elements in the jumbled array, finds the LARGEST element and then
        when it is finished, outputs the smallest element to the screen.
        
        HINT: You will need to use a variable to do this.
      */
      
      /*
        Part 14:
        Create a for loop that loops through the elements in the jumbled array, finds the SMALLEST element and then
        when it is finished, outputs the smallest element to the screen.
      */

      /*
        REVIEW:
        Add 2 divs to the html code at the top of this page and using javascript, select those elements them by their id 
        and set their .innerText property to the smallest and largest number that we found in the jumbled array above.
        
        EX: document.getElementById("...").innerText = SOME_VARIABLE;
