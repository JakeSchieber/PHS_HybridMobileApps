The primary obective for Lesson 11 was to begin to pull everything that we had learned this
semester back together to prepare for our last few days of class. This was enacted with the creation
of a todo app that would allow for students to use what they had learned about arrays and have it be
represented in app form using the CSS and HTML which they learned about at the beginning of the class.

Unfortunately this was a shortened day the students so we only had 25 minutes to work with.

Objectives:
Have the students view the entire stack a full featured app.
Give students the chance to apply their knowledge of arrays
Introduce HTML tables as a way to visualize an array of data.
Introduce how to loop back into the DOM after javascript events.
